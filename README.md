# Automated Seed Sowing Machine using Arduino
This project is designed to automate the process of seed sowing. The system uses Arduino microcontroller, motor drivers, and sensors to control the machine.

# Requirements 
Arduino Uno
Motor drivers (L293D or similar)
DC motors
Sensor (IR or Ultrasonic)
Servo motor
Power supply
Breadboard
Jumper wires

# Installation
Connect the DC motors to the motor drivers and connect the motor drivers to the Arduino Uno.
Connect the sensor to the Arduino Uno and mount it on the machine.
Connect the servo motor to the Arduino Uno and mount it on the machine.
Connect the power supply to the Arduino Uno and the motor drivers.

# Output
The output of the system will be the automatic sowing of seeds in the soil. The machine will move in a straight line and dispense the seeds through the nozzle. The servo motor will be used to adjust the height of the nozzle for different types of seeds.
